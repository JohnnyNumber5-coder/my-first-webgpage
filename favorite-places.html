  <h1>My Favorite Places </h1>
  <h2>Written by: John Nelson</h2>  
  <p>Welcome to my favorite places page! If you were looking for favorite things, you can find that <a href="favthings.html">here</a>
  <p>My top 2 favorite places, in order are:</p>  
  <ol>
    <li>My parent's summer cabin</li>
    <li>Belize</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Summer Cabin</h2>
  <p>Growing up, my parents had a beautiful summer cabin located on the Yakima river, in a golf resort called Sun Country.  We spent every summer there, and I <strong>loved</strong> it! It's where I learned a lot about life.  Unfortunately, I don't have any pictures.   My parents ended up selling after they moved to California.</p>

  <h2>Belize</h2>
  <p>I've only been to Belize once, but I am fascinated by well everything about it really.  The culture, history, ruins, etc.  I would love to return.  In fact, I am planning a trip for winter of 2021! Here are a few pictures.</p>
