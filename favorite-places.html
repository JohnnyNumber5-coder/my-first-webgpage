  <h2>Summer Cabin</h2>
  <p>Growing up, my parents had a beautiful summer cabin located on the Yakima river, in a golf resort called Sun Country.  We spent every summer there, and I <strong>loved</strong> it! It's where I learned a lot about life.  Unfortunately, I don't have any pictures.   My parents ended up selling after they moved to California.</p>
